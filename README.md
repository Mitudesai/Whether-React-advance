Certainly! Here are the setup instructions for cloning a React project, installing dependencies with npm, and obtaining API keys from the OpenWeather website:

Clone the Project:
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the React project. Use the following command to clone the project from its repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mitudesai/Whether-React-advance

Install Dependencies:
After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

cd <project_directory>
Once you're inside the project directory, use npm to install the project dependencies:
npm install
This command installs all the required packages and libraries specified in the package.json file.

Get API Keys from OpenWeather:
Visit the OpenWeather website (https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account if you don't have one. After logging in, navigate to your account dashboard to obtain your API keys.

Locate the section where you can generate API keys.
Copy the API key provided by OpenWeather.
Replace API Keys in the Code:
Open your code editor and find the file where the OpenWeather API key(api/OpenWeatherService.js) is used.
Replace the placeholder or existing API key with the one you obtained from the OpenWeather website.

Start the React App:
Once you've replaced the API key, you can start the React development server using the following command:
npm start
This command will launch the development server, and you should be able to view your React app in your browser.
